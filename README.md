# Digital Engineering Fellowship Educational Project

- In this program, we have done educational documentation on better OOP design. We have implemented a translation of **[Software Design in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaNuP4iB4L6SJlMaHE71FG6N)** YouTube videos (first 10 in the playlist), which are a handy OOP programming principles tutorial on the language of Java as a strong object-oriented programming language. 
In these lessons, you will find:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - **all differences between the two languages on each principle**
&nbsp;&nbsp; - **how Java works better in OOP programming**
&nbsp;&nbsp; - **pros and cons of Python and Java in OOP**
&nbsp;&nbsp; - **how to make a structure for an unstructured Python project in Java**
- As a general recommendation for all lessons, please watch videos of each lesson on YouTube first, understand the principles, and see codes on Python. Then come back to this repository and compare codes and points in both Python and Java. 
- Although Java codes can be implemented more easily, they were designed in a high-level OOP structure for **the best practice**.
We recommend starting with lesson 9, after that 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10. 
- Lessons 4, 5 and 7 were missed as we recognized their translations wouldnâ€™t have any point in terms of Java designing, but we highly recommend watching them and understanding all points and rules.
